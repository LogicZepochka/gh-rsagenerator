# GreyHack RSA Generator
This code is designed to generate a pair of files *encrypt.src* and *decrypt.bin* for ssh connection. The first contains a public key for encrypting the connection, the second contains a private key for decryption.

## Known issues
- The program may crash with the error *'List too big'*. Just restart the script. This is a game limit ~~and I was too lazy to bypass it~~. The script will generate new keys.
